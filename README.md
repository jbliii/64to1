# 64to1
This is the series of scrapers I used to build basketball data visualizations for the 2016 NCAA Tournament. Data is all pulled from sports-reference.com. Many of the later scrapers use the team csv generated in the first scraper.

Final Tableau visualization and a description of the process to build it is at 64to1.com.
